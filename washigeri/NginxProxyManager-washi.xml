    <Overview>This project comes as a pre-built docker image that enables you to easily forward to your websites running at home or otherwise, including free SSL, without having to know too much about Nginx or Letsencrypt.







        Project Goal



        I created this project to fill a personal need to provide users with a easy way to accomplish reverse proxying hosts with SSL termination and it had to be so easy that a monkey could do it. This goal hasn't changed. While there might be advanced options they are optional and the project should be as simple as possible so that the barrier for entry here is low.







        Features



        Beautiful and Secure Admin Interface based on Tabler



        Easily create forwarding domains, redirections, streams and 404 hosts without knowing anything about Nginx



        Free SSL using Let's Encrypt or provide your own custom SSL certificates



        Access Lists and basic HTTP Authentication for your hosts



        Advanced Nginx configuration available for super users



        User management, permissions and audit log</Overview>
